# shake_the_monkey

A test driven exercise using ruby to demonstrate the Shakespeare Infinite Monkeys analogy.

The saying goes that if you had an infinite amount of monkeys with an infinite amount of type-writers they would eventually reproduce the entire works of Shakespeare.

More information can be found [here.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem_in_popular_culture)

Although this theory is not strictly true, this program will go some way to demonstrating the concept of infinity.

It will be able to shuffle the entire works of shakespeare, by character, search for a random word in the resulting works, and repeat the process until that word is found.
